Technical Implementation 

The code uses modern JavaScript with event listeners and DOM manipulation
The UI is built with a clean, responsive design that works across devices
The platform uses client-side data management for demonstration (in production, this would connect to a backend)
The code structure follows best practices for separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JS for behavior)
